# MUST clear cache after every change

**You MUST clear the cache every time** you make a code or UI change to the WorkoutTracker app. Do not skip this.

1. From the **project root** (`WorkoutTracker`), run:
   ```bash
   lsof -ti :8081 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; rm -rf node_modules/.cache .expo/cache $TMPDIR/metro-* $TMPDIR/haste-* 2>/dev/null; npm run start:fresh
   ```
2. Run it in the **background** so the dev server stays up.
3. Tell the user the cache was cleared, the server is running with a fresh bundle, and to **reload the app** in the simulator (**Cmd+R** or force quit and reopen).

If the workspace is `WorkoutTracker/ios`, use:
`cd /Users/fcasanov/Projects/WorkoutTracker && lsof -ti :8081 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null; rm -rf node_modules/.cache .expo/cache $TMPDIR/metro-* $TMPDIR/haste-* 2>/dev/null; npm run start:fresh`

No exceptions: clear cache after every change.
