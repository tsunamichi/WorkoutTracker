# Full reload after code changes

**Every time** we make a code change to the WorkoutTracker app, run a full reload so the user sees updates:

1. From the **project root** (the folder that contains `package.json` and `src/`, i.e. `WorkoutTracker`), run:
   ```bash
   npm run reload
   ```
2. This kills any process on port 8082 and starts Expo with `--clear` on port 8082. Run it in the **background** so the dev server stays up.
3. Tell the user the app has been fully reloaded and they can reload the client (e.g. press `r` in the Expo terminal or shake to reload in the simulator).

If the workspace is `WorkoutTracker/ios`, use the parent directory for the command: `cd /Users/fcasanov/Projects/WorkoutTracker && npm run reload`.
