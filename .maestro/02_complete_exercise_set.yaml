# Smoke Test: TC-1.1 — Start an exercise set, verify timer appears
# Verifies: exercise selection, Start button, timer sheet appears.
# NOTE: The timer sheet uses Animated.View which may not expose text to the
#       accessibility tree. We use screenshot verification instead.

# 1. Launch the app fresh

# 2. Navigate to the workout

# 3. Wait for the execution screen to load
- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible: "Strength Workout"
    timeout: 5000

# 4. Tap "Start" (should be visible since an exercise was previously expanded)
- tapOn:
    text: "Start"

# 5. Wait a moment for the timer animation to complete
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# 6. Take a screenshot — the timer sheet should be visible with "Next set X out of Y"
#    Visual verification: timer circle should be visible, no NaN text
- takeScreenshot: "02_timer_visible"

# 7. Verify the main exercise screen is still behind the timer
#    (Strength Workout should still be partially visible behind the overlay)
- assertVisible: "Strength Workout"
